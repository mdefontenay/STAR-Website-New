                <h3>Airframe</h3>
                Responsible for designing, constructing, and optimizing the structural components of a rocket, including the body and fins. They focus on ensuring the airframe's stability, aerodynamics, and structural integrity to withstand the forces encountered during launch and flight. This team collaborates closely with all subteams to ensure the development of a functioning vehicle.

                <h3>Recovery</h3>
                Responsible for developing and implementing the mechanisms that ensure the safe return of the rocket to the ground after its flight. This includes the design and deployment of recovery systems such as parachutes. The team carefully considers factors like altitude, descent rate, and wind conditions to optimize the recovery process. Collaborating closely with other teams, particularly avionics for accurate timing and deployment control, the recovery team plays a vital role in safeguarding the rocket and its payload during descent.

                Hey there! I'm Brian, a Junior majoring in mechanical engineering. Having been a part of STAR's liquids research team since I came to Berkeley, the talent, energy, and culture on the team is really one of the highlights of being here. Outside of STAR I have a lot of different hobbies and interests that I love to geek out over, from cars and aviation to video games and anime. I'm an avid piano player and enjoy listening to classical music and J-pop.
