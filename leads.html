                Hey there! I'm Brian, a Junior majoring in mechanical engineering. Having been a part of STAR's liquids research team since I came to Berkeley, the talent, energy, and culture on the team is really one of the highlights of being here. Outside of STAR I have a lot of different hobbies and interests that I love to geek out over, from cars and aviation to video games and anime. I'm an avid piano player and enjoy listening to classical music and J-pop.

                Hey there! I'm Brian, a Junior majoring in mechanical engineering. Having been a part of STAR's liquids research team since I came to Berkeley, the talent, energy, and culture on the team is really one of the highlights of being here. Outside of STAR I have a lot of different hobbies and interests that I love to geek out over, from cars and aviation to video games and anime. I'm an avid piano player and enjoy listening to classical music and J-pop.
