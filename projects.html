                <h2>2024-2026</h2>
                We are continuing development of our liquids program, currently designing our 3rd liquid engine (LE3) and its solid demonstrator. We are hoping to hotfire in November of this year, and in this upcoming spring hotfire with a regenerative cooling system. We are looking at making our own tanks and an aluminum airframe for the first time as well. It's our most ambitious project yet!

                <h2>2in Minimum Diameter Rocket</h2>
                MINDI stands for minimum-diameter, and it’s a rocket in which the motor slides directly into the body tube rather than being inserted into a smaller motor-mount tube. Such a design poses challenges when it comes to mounting the fins and retaining the motor, and along with our new project recruits we will work to address these obstacles and build a high-flying rocket.
                <br><br>
                In particular, we have investigated fin glassing and composites techniques, as well as the use of a 3d-printed motor retainer. We have completed manufacturing and are set to launch on December 3rd.
                <br><br>
                This rocket will shatter UC Berkeley’s (and our previous) altitude record at an astonishing 14,000 feet!

                <h2>1st 2-Stage Vehicule</h2>
                Stage Separation rocket (SSEP) was launched in September of 2022.
                <br><br>
                It is a proof-of-concept project testing a two stage airframe design, as well as a spring-actuated separation mechanism that is released upon the detonation of explosive bolts (dubbed pyro bolts). It involved several new recovery methods and new airframe architectures.
                <br><br>
                Stage separation technology makes rockets more efficient by ejecting dead weight and thus this project is a desirable, if not necessary step towards STAR’s eventual spaceshot goal. SSEP’s apogee was around 2,377 feet.

                The Experimental Liquid Low Impulse Engine (ELLIE) is the first time that STAR has attempted to create a bi-propellant rocket engine. Its purpose was to lay the groundwork for a flyable liquid in future iterations.
                <br><br>
                Throughout Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, the propulsion and avionics team carried a long-standing design of the Gaseous Oxygen - liquid Ethanol engine to completion, ending the project with a successful 6 second test fire.
